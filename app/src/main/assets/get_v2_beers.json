This gave the beer a nice caramel flavor. Scottish breweries list their products in ascending order of gravity and strength as Light, Heavy, Export                                  and Strong.

We theorized that if we turned on the brew kettle and heated it up before we sent the wort...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n...to the kettle, it might just carmelize.\r\n\r\nWe were right, and lucky for us, the kettle didn't crack.
